<p>The life cycle of data is</p> plan, capture, manage, analyze, archive and destroy

<ol>
  <li>Plan</li>
  During planning, a business decides what kind of data it needs, how it will be managed throughout its life cycle, who will be responsible for it, and the optimal outcomes.
  <li>Capture</li>
  This is where data is collected from a variety of different sources and brought into the organization. One common method is getting data from outside resources.
  <li>Manage</li>
   How we care for our data, how and where it's stored, the tools used to keep it safe and secure, and the actions taken to make sure that it's maintained properly.
  <li>Analyze</li>
  This is where data analysts really shine. In this phase, the data is used to solve problems, make great decisions, and support business goals.
  <li>Archive</li>
  Archiving means storing data in a place where it's still available, but may not be used again. 
  <li>Destroy</li>
  To destroy it, the company would use a secure data erasure software. If there were any paper files, they would be shredded too. This is important for protecting a company's private information, as well as private data about its customers.
