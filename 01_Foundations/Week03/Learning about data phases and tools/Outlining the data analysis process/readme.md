<h1>Six phases of data analysis</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Ask</li>
    We define the problem to be solved and we make sure that we fully understand stakeholder expectations.
  <li>Prepare</li>
  This is where data analysts collect and store data they'll use for the upcoming analysis process.
  <li>Process</li>
   Here, data analysts find and eliminate any errors and inaccuracies that can get in the way of results. This usually means cleaning data, transforming it into a more useful format, combining two or more datasets to make information more complete and removing outliers, which are any data points that could skew the information.
  <li>Analyze</li>
  Analyzing the data you've collected involves using tools to transform and organize that information so that you can draw useful conclusions, make predictions, and drive informed decision-making.
  <li>Share</li>
  How data analysts interpret results and share them with others to help stakeholders make effective data-driven decisions
  <li>Act</li>
</ul>
