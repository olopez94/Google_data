<h1>Using data to drive successful outcomes</h1>

<p><b>Data-riven decision-making</b> - Using facts to guide business strategy.

  Data analysts can tap into the power of data to do all kinds of amazing things. With data, they can gain valuable insights, verify their theories or assumptions, better understand opportunities and challenges, support an objective, help make a plan, and much more.

<p><b>Tehnical mindset</b> - Everyone has instincts or gut feelings. Data analysts are no different. 
  
  But they've trained themselves to build on those feelings and use a more technical approach to explore them. They do this by always seeking out the facts, putting them to work through analysis, and using the insights they gain to make informed decisions </p>


<p><b>Data design</b>- Designing your data so that is organized in a logical way makes it easy for data analysts to access, understand, and make the most of available information.</p>

<p><b>Data Strategy</b>- which incorporates the people, processes, and tools used to solve a problem. This is a big one to remember because data strategy gives you a high-level view of the path you need to take to achieve your goals. </p>
