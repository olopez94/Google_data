<p>Every programming language, including SQL, follows a unique set of guidelines known as syntax. 
  
  Syntax is the predetermined structure of a language that includes all required words, symbols, and punctuation, as well as their proper placement.</p>


<ul>
  <li>Use <b>SELECT</b> to choose the columns you want to return.</li>
  <li>Use <b>FROM</b> to choose the tables where the columns you want are located.</li>
  </ul>
