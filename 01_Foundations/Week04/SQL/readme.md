<p>Every programming language, including SQL, follows a unique set of guidelines known as syntax. 
  
  Syntax is the predetermined structure of a language that includes all required words, symbols, and punctuation, as well as their proper placement.</p>


<ul>
  <li>Use <b>SELECT</b> to choose the columns you want to return.</li>
  <li>Use <b>FROM</b> to choose the tables where the columns you want are located.</li>
  <li>Use <b>WHERE</b> to filter for certain information.</li>
  </ul>


<h2><b>Example of a query</b></h2>
