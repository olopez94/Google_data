<h1>Planning a data visualization</h1>

<p>Because of the importance of data visualization, most data analytics tools (such as spreadsheets and databases) have a built-in visualization component while others (such as Tableau) specialize in visualization as their primary value-add.</p>


<h2>Steps to plan a data visualization</h2>
<p> Imagine you’re a data analyst for a clothing distributor. The company helps small clothing stores manage their inventory, and sales are booming. One day, you learn that your company is getting ready to make a major update to its website. To guide decisions for the website update, you’re asked to analyze data from the existing website and sales records. </p>


<ol>
  <li>Explore the data for patterns</li>
  <p>First, you ask your manager or the data owner for access to the current sales records and website analytics reports. 
  
  While reviewing the data you notice a pattern among those who visit the company’s website most frequently: geography and larger amounts spent on purchases.</p>
  <li>Plan your visuals</li>
  <p>You will want to create a data visualization that explains your findings quickly and effectively to your target audience</p>
  <li>Create your visuals</li>
  <p> Keep in mind that creating the right visualization for a presentation or to share with stakeholders is a process. It involves trying different visualization formats and making adjustments until you get what you are looking for. In this case, a mix of different visuals will best communicate your findings and turn your analysis into the most compelling story for stakeholders. </p>
