<h1>Columns and rows and cells, oh my!</h1>
<p>Columns are organized vertically in a spreadsheet and are ordered by letter. And the rows are organized horizontally and are ordered by number. So when you talk about a specific cell, you name it by combining the column letter and the row number where the cell is located.

For example, in this spreadsheet, the word 'row' is in cell D3</p>
