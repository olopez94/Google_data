 <li>Collaborate with stakeholders and keep an open line of communication</li>
 <li>Take a step back and see the whole situation in context</li>
 </ul>

<h2>2 PREPARE</h2>
<p>You will decide what data you need to collect in order to answer your questions and how to organize it so that it is useful.</p>
<ul>
 <li>What metrics to measure</li>
 <li>Locate data in your database</li>
 <li>Create security measures to protect that data</li>
 </ul>

<h2>3 PROCESS</h2>
<p>Clean data is the best data and you will need to clean up your data to get rid of any possible errors, inaccuracies, or inconsistencies.</p>

<ul>
 <li>Using spreadsheet functions to find incorrectly entered data </li>
 <li>Using SQL functions to check for extra spaces</li>

 </ul>
 
<h2>4 ANALYZE </h2>
