<h1>Data in action</h1>
 ...
 
<h1> The six data analysis phases</h1>

<h2> 1 ASK</h2>

<ul>
 <li>Define the problem you’re trying to solve </li>
 <li>Make sure you fully understand the stakeholder’s expectations</li>
 <li>Focus on the actual problem and avoid any distractions</li>
 <li>Collaborate with stakeholders and keep an open line of communication</li>
 <li>Take a step back and see the whole situation in context</li>
 </ul>

<h2>2 PREPARE</h2>
<p>You will decide what data you need to collect in order to answer your questions and how to organize it so that it is useful.</p>
<ul>
 <li>What metrics to measure</li>
 <li>Locate data in your database</li>
 <li>Create security measures to protect that data</li>
 </ul>

<h3>3 PROCESS</h3>
<p>Clean data is the best data and you will need to clean up your data to get rid of any possible errors, inaccuracies, or inconsistencies.</p>

<ul>
 <li>Using spreadsheet functions to find incorrectly entered data </li>
 <li>Using SQL functions to check for extra spaces</li>
 <li>Removing repeated entries</li>
 <li>Checking as much as possible for bias in the data</li>
 </ul>
